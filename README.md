Topic: "How can we build trustworthy artificial intelligence? "

Professor: Dr. Asim Roy

- Building a deep learning model using CNN custom architecture to gain 99.20% accuracy.
- Deep dive into all layers of the model to visualize the activation nodes specific to the layer along with the individual activation value.
- Applying with different approaches to find a pattern from the activations at the penultimate layer and looking for patterns in a subset
-Defining and proving the patterns between activation nodes, that explains the sparse coding behavior of the CNN.
- Calculating a frequency matrix for 10K test images to prove the intersection between activation nodes for various inputs.
